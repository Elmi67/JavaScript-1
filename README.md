# JavaScript

## The Fundamentals

JavaScript (more formally known as ECMAScript, but fortunately nobody goes there) is a _scripting_
language for web sites. JavaScript is used to add interactive features to a web site. It is a facinating (and frustrating) subject and we'll only be able to scratch the surface here.

What I want you to come away with is:

1. The knowledge of what JavaScript is and how to add JavaScript to a web page.
2. A rudimentary understanding of how to read the code.
3. Some experience finding and reusing useful bits of code – basiclly seeing how much you can do without having to be expert in writing JavaScript.
4. Knowing how to learn more on your own.

## What you're expected to know and be able to do

### Vocabulary

* JavaScript
* script / scripting language
* client-side / server-side
* event
* DOM
* string
* boolean
* variable
* function
* array
* if statement (or if/else)
* jQuery
* API
* library

### Skills

* Explain the role of JavaScript in modern web site development.
* Explain how JavaScript "works:" How do you add JavaScript to a web page?
  What causes the JavaScript to run? How does the JavaScript change the web page?
* Explain the purpose and use of JavaScript libraries such as JQuery. When would you use a library?
  How would you connect it to your page?
* Add some JavaScript to a web site.
* View your browser's JavaScript console.
* Solve a (simple) JavaScript problem through your own research.

## Things To Try

* [CodeAcademy: Annimate Your Name](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/animate-your-name): this is a relatively gentle introduction to coding in JavaScript. It covers some of the most common data types, strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays. It also introduces the notion of a function and making decisions with if statements. The drag of this lesson is that they hide the code that does the cool stuff from you.

* [HTML Dog JavaScript Beginner Tutorial](http://htmldog.com/guides/javascript/) or the
[JavaScript Roadtrip](http://javascript-roadtrip.codeschool.com) – with the goal of learning how to connect JavaScript to a web page.

* The HTML ```<canvas>``` tag provides a fun way to explore JavaScript and graphics. The Mozilla Developer Network has a decent [Canvas Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial).

* Loops are a basic – but extremely useful – programming technique. This [Loops](http://www.echoecho.com/javascript9.htm) tutorial is a fairly simple introduction. The file for-loop.html in this repository is a small, but useful, example of how a loop could be used.

## How To Show That You've Got It

1. Start a JavaScript repository on your GitHub account and use it to store your work with JavaScript. Practice with git whenever you can till it becomes second nature.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine and follow the instructions in js101.html. After each step test your work and commit your changes to GitHub.
