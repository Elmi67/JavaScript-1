# JavaScript

## The Fundamentals

JavaScript (more formally known as ECMAScript, but fortunately nobody goes there) is a _scripting_
language for web sites. JavaScript is used to add interactive features to a web site. It is a facinating (and frustrating) subject and we'll only be able to scratch the surface here.

What I want you to come away with is:

1. The knowledge of what JavaScript is and how to add JavaScript to a web page.
2. A rudimentary understanding of how to read the code.
3. Some experience finding and reusing useful bits of code – basiclly seeing how much you can do without having to be expert in writing JavaScript.
4. Knowing how to learn more on your own.

## What you're expected to know and be able to do

* JavaScript
* script / scripting language
* client-side / server-side

### Skills

* Explain the role of JavaScript in modern web site development.
* Explain how JavaScript "works:" How do you add JavaScript to a web page?
  What causes the JavaScript to run? How does the JavaScript change the web page?
* Explain the purpose and use of JavaScript libraries such as JQuery. When would you use a library?
  How would you connect it to your page?
* Add some JavaScript to a web site.
* View your browser's JavaScript console.
* Solve a (simple) JavaScript problem through your own research.

### The Rubric

## Things To Try

* [CodeAcademy: Annimate Your Name](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/animate-your-name): this is a relatively gentle introduction to coding in JavaScript. It covers some of the most common data types, strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays. It also introduces the notion of a function and making decisions with if statements. The drag of this lesson is that they hide the code that does the cool stuff from you.
